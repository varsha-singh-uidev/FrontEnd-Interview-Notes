# JavaScript & Front-End Interview Preparation

This repository is created for **systematic preparation of Front-End Developer interviews**.
It contains **hands-on coding questions**, **theory-based interview questions**, and **well-structured JavaScript concepts** that are frequently asked in real interviews.

The goal of this repository is:
- To strengthen JavaScript fundamentals
- To practice coding questions asked in interviews
- To revise important Front-End concepts efficiently
