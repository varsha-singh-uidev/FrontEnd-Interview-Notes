## Most Frequently Asked Frontend Interview Question ##

## HTML ##
1. What are semantic HTML elements? Give examples.
Ans = Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning and purpose to both the browser and developers(<header>, <footer> etc).
      They improve: Accessibility, SEO, Code readability.

2. Difference between block, inline, and inline-block elements?
Ans = Block: Takes full width, starts on a new line. Example: <div>, <p>.
      Inline: Fits only the content, doesn’t start a new line. Example: <span>, <a>.
      Inline-block: Behaves like inline but allows setting width/height. Example: <img>.

3. What is the difference between <div> and <span>?
Ans = <div>: Block-level, starts from the new line, used to group larger sections of content.
      <span>: Inline-level, doesn't start from the new line, used to style or mark small parts of text.

4. What are HTML5 new features?
Ans = Key additions:
      Semantic elements: <header>, <footer>, <article>
      Multimedia: <audio>, <video>
      Graphics: <canvas>, <svg>
      APIs: Geolocation, Drag & Drop, Web Storage
      Form enhancements: email, date, required, placeholder.

5. Difference between HTML and XHTML?
Ans = HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
      Introduced: 1991 by Tim Berners‑Lee.
      Flexible rules: Browsers forgive small mistakes (like unclosed tags).
      Case-insensitive: Tags can be uppercase or lowercase.
      Attributes: Quotes around attribute values are optional.
      Goal: Easy to write, more forgiving for developers.

<!-- Valid in HTML -->
<p>Hello World
<br>

    XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)
    Introduced: January 26, 2000 (XHTML 1.0 by W3C).
    Strict rules: Must follow XML syntax.
    Case-sensitive: Tags must be lowercase.
    Well-formed: Every tag must be properly closed (<br /> instead of <br>).
    Attributes: Values must always be quoted.
    Goal: Cleaner, consistent code and well‑formed documents.

<!-- Required in XHTML -->
<p>Hello World</p>
<br />

6. Difference between id and class?
Ans = (id)
      Unique identifier for a single element.
      Can’t be reused on multiple elements in the same page.
      Used when you want to target one specific element.
      Higher CSS priority.
      Example: <h1 id="main-title">Welcome</h1>

      (class)
      Can be applied to multiple elements.
      Useful for grouping and styling many elements together.
      Often used with CSS and JavaScript for shared behavior.
      Lower CSS priority.
      Example: <p class="highlight">First paragraph</p>

7. Difference between relative, absolute, and fixed URLs?
Ans = Relative URL
      Definition: Points to a file relative to the current page’s location.
      Use: Shorter, depends on where the file is stored.
      Example: If your page is in a folder, and the image is in the same folder, you just say: <img src="logo.png">

      Absolute URL
      Definition: Full path including domain name.
      Use: Always points to the same resource, no matter where the page is.
      Example: This is the full address of something on the internet. <img src="https://example.com/images/logo.png">

      Fixed URL
      Definition: A fixed URL is a link that always points to the same place on a website, no matter where the page is.
      Use: Tied to a specific location, less flexible.
      Example: Starts from the root (home) of the website. <img src="/images/logo.png">

8. What are data-* attributes used for?
Ans = Definition: data-* attributes are custom attributes in HTML used to store extra information about an element without
      affecting the layout and behavior.
      Purpose: They let developers add small bits of data to HTML elements, which can later be accessed with JavaScript.

      Example: <button data-user-id="123">Click</button>
               const btn = document.querySelector("button");
               console.log(btn.dataset.userId);

9. Difference between <script>, <script async>, and <script defer>?
Ans = <script>
      Default behavior: Browser stops loading the page, runs the script immediately, then continues.
      Effect: Can block page rendering if the script is large.

      <script async>
      Behavior: Script loads in the background while the page continue loading.
      Effect: Once Script loads it runs it immediately(may interrupt page rendering).

      <script defer>
      Behavior: Scripts load in the background but waits untill the Html is fully parsed.
      Effect: Script runs after the page is ready.
